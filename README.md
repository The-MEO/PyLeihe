# PyLeihe
Python module to search in all German online libraries that work with the software `Onleihe`.

## Installation
1. To use the module including command line interface you need [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
    _For the later call it is easiest if python is included in the path variable._
3. clone or download this repository
4. open your preferred console program in the downloaded project folder
5. Install the required dependencies
    ```
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If you want to develop the source code further, there are some interesting tools (like `pytest`) in requirements_tools.txt
6. Start the command line program and display the corresponding help text:
    ```
    python -m PyLeihe -h
    ```
